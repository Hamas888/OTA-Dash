# OTA-Dash
OTA-Dash is a plug-and-play ESP32 library that launches a web-based interface when connected to the device’s access point. It allows developers to perform OTA updates, view logs in real-time, reset or configure Wi-Fi, and manage EEPROM/settings — making it the perfect foundation for any wireless IoT application.
